# Personas

Pepperi Personas are used to identify unmet user needs, which consist of goals and pain points. Each persona has attributes such as age, gender, location, role, position, audience, context, description, motivations, goals, pain points, tech literacy, device, paying, offline, platform, products, product use cases, and configurations. There are 8 roles identified: Executive Decision Maker, Admin, Manager, Rep, Buyer, Merchandiser, Driver.

Personas provides a basis for strategic discussions. Instead of talking about general *users* we can talk about actual people like Jack (who just wants to get things done) or Jill (the the tech genius how loves knowing what’s under the hood) and their needs. Personas represent different roles, users or target audience, of the company, service or product that we’re trying to promote build or improve. We’ll use the Personas for each decision we make we should ask what would Jack and Jill think about this.
