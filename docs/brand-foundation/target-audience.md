# Personas

Personas provide a basis for strategic discussions. Instead of talking about general *users*, we can discuss actual people like Jack (who just wants to get things done) or Jill (the tech genius who loves knowing what’s under the hood) and their needs. 

Personas represent different roles, users, or target audiences of the company, service, or product that we’re trying to promote, build, or improve. For each decision we make, we should ask: what would Jack and Jill think about this?

Pepperi Personas are used to identify unmet user needs, which consist of goals and pain points. Each persona has attributes such as age, gender, location, role, position, audience, context, description, motivations, goals, pain points, tech literacy, device usage, payment preferences, offline behavior, platform usage, products, product use cases, and configurations. 

At Pepperi we identified 8 roles: Executive Decision Maker, Admin, Manager, Rep, Buyer, Merchandiser, Driver.
